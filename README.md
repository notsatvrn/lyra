Lyra is a 64-bit UNIX-like hobby kernel for learning operating system development in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

## Goals

- Readable and easy to understand codebase
- Multi-architecture support (x86, RISC-V, ARM)
- Modern design with [Limine](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine) boot protocol

## Non-goals

- Legacy support (32-bit, pre-Nehalem CPUs, etc)
- Obscure hardware support (e.g. big-endian)

## Progress

- generic
  - [x] tty
    - [x] text mode impl
    - [x] framebuffer impl
  - [ ] memory
    - [x] pmm
    - [ ] vmm
  - [ ] process scheduler
    - [x] red-black tree impl
    - [ ] process structures
    - [ ] smp awareness
- x86-64
  - [x] gdt/idt
  - [ ] timing
    - [x] counter
    - [x] system clock
    - [ ] early boot clock
  - [ ] smp
    - [x] core id storage
  - [x] interrupts
