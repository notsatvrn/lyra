Lyra is a 64-bit UNIX-like hobby kernel for learning operating system development in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

## Goals

- Readable and easy to understand codebase
- Modern design with [Limine](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine) boot protocol
- (in the future) Multi-architecture support

## Progress

- generic
