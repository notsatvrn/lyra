# lyra

Lyra is a 64-bit UNIX-like hobby kernel for learning operating system development in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

## Goals

- Readable and easy to understand codebase
- Minimalist design with microkernel model
- Modern design with [Limine](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine) boot protocol

## Non-goals

- Legacy support (32-bit, pre-Nehalem CPUs, etc)
- Obscure hardware support (e.g. big-endian)

## Credits

- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) for being the best programming language ðŸ˜‰
- [AndreaOrru](https://github.com/AndreaOrru) for the [zen](https://github.com/AndreaOrru/zen/tree/reboot) kernel project (on which this project is based)
